	abstract = {Maxwellâ€™s equations are replaced by a set of finite diference equations. It is shown that if one chooses the field points appropriately, the set of finite difference equation is applicable for a boundary condition involving perfectly conducting surfaces. An example is given of the scattering of an electromagnetic pulse by a perfectly conducting cylinder},
